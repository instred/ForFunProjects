### This is a Discord bot, that I created just to experiment with using APis

 * The bot takes an english words dictionary API key and explain the word someone types on a discord server using !whatis command or !!whatis to send answear by a private message.

 * It operates using Discord API key, to read user messages. Then I check if the message is a proper command, so I can parse the user text to a dictionary API class, which gets me the word meaning, so I can make an answer on discord.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Discord API and Dictionary API keys ar changed to ensure it's all secure.


Here's a little preview how it's working:

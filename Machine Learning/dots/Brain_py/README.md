# Pathfinding/Learning algorithm - Dots
This is my first ML app, a simple one but I had to start with something.
It was created using Processing IDE and written in Java since Processing does not have very good Python support.

It's based on a genetic algorithm, that uses evolution and mutation to find better path to the Red Dot every generation.
Essentially, you take the best Dots from each generation and base the next generation on them by mutating their "babies"
Each Dot has a fitness score value based on how far from the Goal is it, with addition of penalties for hitting walls.

Also, by clicking with mouse you can place the Red Dot Goal somewhere else and see how the generation works to find new targert

## Flappy bird clone, to create a AI that using Neural Networks will get the highest score

This is by far the biggest project for me (for now at least).
All of this will be created using Python and some of its libraries

 * First, I created a copy of flappy bird using Pygame library, overall mechanic of the game is there, but still needs a couple fixes to be perfect.

 * Then I will create (or try to create) an AI algorithm that will optimize its movement in game using Neural Networks to get highest score possible.

*Sneak Peak of the game*
